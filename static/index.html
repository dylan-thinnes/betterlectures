		<div class="paddedText limitWidth">I was very annoyed by the extremely slow and large interface of Echo360, so I downloaded my lectures to see them offline more conveniently. Here I store them so they can be viewed faster and downloaded far more easily for future use of myself and others.<br/>I readily accept that my clunky and ugly interface isn't much of an improvement other than that it is fast and legible (gimme a break, I didn't take very long on this). As such, I dub this site "SlightlyBetter" only. Who knows, with enough work in the future that might change.</div>
